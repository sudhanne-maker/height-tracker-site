        <ul>
            <li>Height measurement recording and tracking for multiple children</li>
            <li>Growth visualization through interactive charts</li>
            <li>Growth percentile comparisons using WHO and CDC reference data</li>

            <li>Local backup and restore of all app data</li>
            <li>Customizable measurement reminder notifications</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use of the App</h2>
        <p><strong>Permitted Use:</strong> You may use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes to track height growth for your children or those in your legal care.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>The App is not a medical device and is not intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Growth percentiles and predictions are statistical estimates based on population reference data and the measurements you enter</li>
            <li>The App uses WHO and CDC growth reference data for informational and educational purposes only</li>
            <li>Growth velocity indicators and trend analysis are approximate and for general interest only</li>
            <li>Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for any medical concerns about your child's growth or development</li>
            <li>Do not make medical decisions based solely on information from this App</li>
            <li>If you have concerns about your child's growth, please see a pediatrician</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AR Measurement Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The App includes an augmented reality (AR) height measurement feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AR measurements are approximate and may vary based on lighting conditions, device position, and environmental factors</li>
            <li>AR accuracy depends on device capabilities (LiDAR-equipped devices provide better results)</li>
            <li>AR measurements should be verified with a physical measuring tool for accuracy</li>
            <li>The developer is not responsible for inaccuracies in AR-based measurements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Accuracy of Predictions</h2>
        <p>Adult height predictions and growth percentiles are statistical estimates based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The measurements you enter into the App</li>
            <li>WHO and CDC population reference data</li>
            <li>Mathematical algorithms including linear regression and mid-parental height formulas</li>
            <li>Parent height information you optionally provide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These predictions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are not guaranteed to be accurate</li>
            <li>Should be considered estimates only</li>
            <li>May vary significantly from actual outcomes</li>
            <li>Require a minimum of three measurements for calculation</li>
            <li>Include confidence indicators to help you assess reliability</li>
